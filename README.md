# Plants-vs-Zombies-TAS-Project
This TAS builds off of the "Python vs. Zombies" project created by the Chinese community for PvZ and uses it to try to complete the Any% Speedrun as fast as possible.  This project directly reads and writes to PvZ memory in order to simulate what perfect rng might look like.
